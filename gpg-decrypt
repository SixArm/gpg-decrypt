# GPG script to decrypt a file with our typical settings.
#
# Example:
#
#     $ gpg-decrypt example.txt.gpg
#     (prompt for password)
#     #=> example.txt.gpg
#
# To get our settings, we use these gpg options:
#
#    --quiet                       Try to be as quiet as possible.
#    --no-greeting                 Suppress the initial copyright message but do not enter batch mode.
#
# If you are on an older system, then you may want to add this:
#
#    --no-use-agent                Do not use a system agent such as Ubuntu's gnome-keyring process.
